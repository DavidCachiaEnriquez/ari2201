# IAPT (ARI2201) - "Playing Games via Gestures"
Welcome to the project for my University of Malta, ARI2201 Individual Assigned Practical Task <i>(IAPT)</i>. The title of the project is "Playing Games via Gestures"

The aim of this project was to implement a simple javascript game, but instead of using keyboard input controls, the game would be played via different gestures. This would be done by making use of Google's Teachable Machine. The game chosen to be implemented is thte 1986 arcade game of <i>Arkanoid</i>. This would all be done as a web applciation thats fully accesible from anywhere and at any time.

The game can be found and played <a href="https://davidcachiaenriquez.github.io/ari2201/" target="_blank">here</a>. The hosting was done via GithubPages.
